## How It Works

1.  **Isolation:** When you start copying someone, the bot creates a unique sub-wallet dedicated to that specific trader.
2.  **Deposit:** You must deposit funds into this new sub-wallet to begin.
3.  **Proportional Sizing:** The bot trades based on percentage, not fixed amounts. If the trader uses **10%** of their portfolio for a trade, the bot will use **10%** of your sub-wallet's balance to match it.

## Commands

### `/copy`
Mirror the moves of a winning trader. Use this command to start a new copy-trade or manage existing ones.

**How to Start:**
1.  Type `/copy`.
2.  The bot will ask for the **Wallet Address** you want to copy.
3.  The bot generates a new **Sub-Wallet** for this connection.
4.  Deposit funds into this sub-wallet to activate the copy.

**How to Manage:**
* Type `/copy` again to see a list of all traders you are currently copying.
* From this menu, you can check your profits, withdraw funds, or click **Stop Copying** to end the automation.

### `/counter`
Bet against a specific trader. If they open a Long, you automatically open a Short.

**How to Start:**
1.  Type `/counter`.
2.  The bot will ask for the **Wallet Address** you want to trade against.
3.  The bot generates a new **Sub-Wallet** for this connection.
4.  Deposit funds into this sub-wallet to activate the counter-trade.

**How to Manage:**
* Type `/counter` again to view your active "inverse" setups.
* Use the menu to monitor performance or stop counter-trading a specific wallet.
