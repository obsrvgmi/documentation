## Commands

### `/copy`
Mirror the moves of a winning trader.
When you use this command with a wallet address, the bot will automatically open the exact same trades as that user—buying when they buy and selling when they sell.
* **Usage:** `/copy [Wallet Address] [Amount]`
* **Best for:** Following "Whales" or top-ranked leaderboard players.

### `/counter`
Bet against a specific trader.
If the target trader opens a Long position, your bot will automatically open a Short. If they Short, you Long. This is a powerful tool if you identify a trader who is consistently wrong.
* **Usage:** `/counter [Wallet Address] [Amount]`
* **Best for:** Profiting from "inverse" signals or betting against rivals.

## Managing Your Automations

Once you have set up a copy or counter trade, you may need to adjust or stop it.

### `/list-copy`
View all wallets you are currently copying or countering. This shows your active automated setups and their performance.

### `/stop-copy`
Stop copying a specific wallet. The bot will instantly stop opening new positions based on that user's activity.
