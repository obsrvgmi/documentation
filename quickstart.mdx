## Market Intelligence
Tools to analyze price action and track specific assets.

| Command | Description |

| **/markets** | Displays a dashboard of all listed trading pairs with live prices and 24h change %. Click on any ticker to quickly pull up its chart or trade menu. |
| **/chart** `[token]` | Generates a real-time candlestick chart for the requested asset inside Telegram. Includes basic indicators and timeframe toggles (15m, 1H, 4H). |
| **/watchlist** | Shows your personal list of favorite **Token Pairs** (e.g., APT-USD, ETH-USD). Use this to keep a close eye on the assets you trade most frequently. |
| **/alert** `[token]` | Sets a custom price alert for a specific token. The bot will send you a DM immediately when the price hits your target, ensuring you never miss an entry. |

## Trading Management
Core commands for executing, managing, and closing positions.

| Command | Description |

| **/limit** `[token]` | Opens the Limit Order interface. Allows you to set precise entry prices to buy (Long) or sell (Short) only when the market reaches your specific level. |
| **/positions** | Fetches a summary of all your currently active positions. View your entry price, liquidation price, and real-time PnL (ROI%) for every open trade. |
| **/close** | The quick-exit tool. typing `/close` brings up a menu of open positions to close individually, or options to close **All Longs**, **All Shorts**, or **Everything** at market price. |
| **/orders** | Manages your "Open Book." View all pending limit orders or triggered stop orders. You can cancel specific orders or wipe the entire book with one click. |
| **/tp** `[token]` | Adds or edits a **Take Profit** trigger on an open position. You can set this by price target (e.g., $2500) or by percentage gain (e.g., +50% ROI). |
| **/sl** `[token]` | Adds or edits a **Stop Loss** trigger. Essential for risk management, this automatically closes your trade if the price moves against you to prevent liquidation. |
