| **/short** `[token]` | Opens a short position on the specified token (e.g., `/short SOL`). If no token is provided, it opens the asset selection menu.                 |
| **/positions**       | Fetches all currently active positions. Shows real-time PnL, entry price, liquidation price, and provides options to close or edit trades.      |
| **/close** `[token]` | Closes an active position immediately at market price. If no token is specified, it provides a list of positions to choose from.                |

  **Pro Tip:** You can reply to any token ticker posted in a group chat with `/long` or `/short` to instantly queue a trade for that asset.
